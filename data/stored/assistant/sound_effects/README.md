## Data - stored - assistant - sound effects 🔊
The sound effects used by the assistant. The sound effects must be stored in the ```.wav``` format.

They are divided into three categories:
- **fillers**: used to fill the silence before the assistant speaks.
- **start**: used to indicate the start of something, in most cases the start of the program.
- **end**: used to indicate the end of something, in most cases the end of the program.

These folders are modulable, you can add or remove sound effects as you wish.
