## Data - stored - assistant - voices 🔊
The data about the voices of the assistant, the agent that is able to interact with the user. In this folder are stored the different voices of the assistant due to the ability of some TTS models to clone a voice. Feel free to add your own voice here and change the parameters of the State Machine to use it.

Be careful, some TTS models are not able to clone a voice or have very poor results.

The format of the voice files can be different depending on the TTS model used. The most common formats are ```.wav``` and ```.mp3```.
