## Data - stored - assistant 🦾🔊
The data about the assistant, the agent that is able to interact with the user. In this folder are stored some prompt files ```hi.txt```, ```bye.txt```, ```context.txt``` but also the different voices of the assistant in the ```voices/``` folder due to the ability of some TTS models to clone a voice. The sound effects are also stored in the ```sound_effects/``` folder.
