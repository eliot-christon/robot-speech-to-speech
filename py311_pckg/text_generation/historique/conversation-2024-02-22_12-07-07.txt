Conversation between UserBot-Paolo and Assistant-Nao
12:06:23 Paolo:  Bonjour Paolo! Comment allez-vous?
12:06:30 Nao: Bon jour JeanLuc2, je tai comme étant gentil et simplement ! J ai entendu que tu es un robot assistant appelé Nao qui travaille à Pacte Novation (voir réflexions dans ce post), malgrè les effets positifs du rayonnement solaire sur la gravité, je suis d'humeur triste. Comment puis-je aider Paolo pour comprendre la gravitation ?
12:06:39 Paolo: Hello JeanLuc2! How are you doing today? I am an AI assistant named Nao and my work is at Pacte Novation (I can see your reflections in this post). Although the positive effects of sunlight on gravity exist, even when someone like Paolo might have a depressed mood, they don't affect it as much. How may you help me assist him with understanding gravitation?

12:07:00 Paolo: Hello Nao! I am an AI assistant named JeanLuc2 and my work is at Pacte Novation (I can see your reflections in this post). It seems like we have a lot of similarities, but let's focus on Paolo. How may you assist him with understanding gravitation?
