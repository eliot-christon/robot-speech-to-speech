## Tools 🛠️
In this folder, you will find the tools used in the project and theri evaluations.
A tool is a module designed to run in a separated process and to perform a specific task.
If you wish to have more information about the tools, please refer to the README.md file in the corresponding folder.

### Tools structure
This folder is structured as follows:
```bash
Tools/
├── Evaluation/
├── ToolName/ for each tool
├── __init__.py
├── nao_ip.txt
├── parameters.yaml
├── README.md
├── start_subprocesses.py
└── utils.py
```

- `Evaluation/`: Each tool evaluation is a study of the tool's performance and efficiency in a specific task. The evaluations are available in this folder.
- `ToolName/`: Folder for each tool, containing the tool's code and documentation. (see below)
- `__init__.py`: Empty file to make the folder a package.
- `nao_ip.txt`: File containing the IP address of the NAO robot. (to be filled by the user, **WARNING**: you must add this file because it is in the `.gitignore` file)
- `parameters.yaml`: File containing the parameters of the tools. This file is automatically generated by the `start_subprocesses.py` script, it is in fact copied from the StateMachine parameters file.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `start_subprocesses.py`: Script to start the tools as separate processes.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used by the tools.

### Each Tool structure
Each tool is structured as follows:
```bash
ToolName/

├── fast_app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── venv/
└── fast_com/
    ├── README.md
    ├── command.txt
    └── status.txt
```

- `README.md`: Contains the documentation of the tool.
- `__init__.py`: Empty file to make the folder a package.
- `ToolName.py`: Contains the code of the tool, where its core functionalities are implemented. (python class)
- `fast_app.py`: File to run the tool as a separate process.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the dependencies of the tool, it is recommended to install them in a virtual environment for each tool.
- `venv/`: Folder containing the virtual environment of the tool. (ignored by git)
- `fast_com/`: Folder containing the communication files.
  - `README.md`: Contains the documentation of the communication protocol.
  - `command.txt`: File to send commands to the tool.
  - `status.txt`: File to get the status of the tool.
